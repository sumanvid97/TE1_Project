# Gap Classification of a 3-Legged Unsignalized Intersection
This project was undertaken as a part of the course CE 310: Transportation Engineering I at IIT Bombay. 

Gap classification and acceptance predictions provide very important inputs for performance evaluation and safety analysis of 3-legged uncontrolled intersections at road networks. Reliable techniques can be used in advanced safety warning systems for vehicles and pedestrians waiting to cross major stream vehicles. The focus of this project was on the application of SVM, binary logit model (BLM) and ANN in understanding and classifying gaps at these facilities and comparing the results amongst these techniques to find the one with better skill scores.

Have a look at the [report] for results and conclusion.
